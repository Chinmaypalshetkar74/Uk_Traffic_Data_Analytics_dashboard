# Uk_Traffic_Data_Analytics_dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This dashboard provides an analytical overview of UK vehicle traffic trends from 2000 to 2024, focusing on miles driven by different vehicle types across UK regions. All insights are drawn using data visualization and interactive analysis built with Streamlit.

📈 Key Conclusions from Data (2000–2024)
🚗 Steady Growth till 2018: Traffic volumes for most vehicle types, especially Cars, Taxis, and Light Vans, increased consistently from 2000 to 2018.
📉 2020 Traffic Drop: A significant decline in miles driven was observed in 2020 across all vehicle types and regions, likely due to pandemic-related lockdowns.
🔄 Post-2020 Recovery: Data shows a clear recovery trend by 2024, with some categories nearing or surpassing pre-pandemic levels.
🚲 Cycling Popularity in London: Pedal cycles saw strong growth in London, indicating a shift toward sustainable transport.
🚌 Public Transport Variation: Buses and Coaches declined overall, but London remained relatively stable, thanks to its extensive public transport infrastructure.
🚚 Rise in Light Vans: Steady growth from 2000–2024, reflecting increased commercial and delivery activities.
🧠 Dashboard Strengths
✅ Interactive filtering by vehicle type and region
📊 Dynamic line, bar, and pie charts showing traffic trends
📍 Region-wise comparison with visual context
🕵️ Clear visibility into changes over time without statistical modeling
⚠️ Limitations
Data is aggregated annually — finer time intervals (e.g., monthly) are not explored.
The dashboard reflects descriptive analytics only; no predictive models or forecasting were applied.
External factors (e.g., fuel prices, policy changes, population shifts) are not incorporated in this analysis.
✅ Recommendations
🚴 Expand cycling infrastructure in other UK regions based on London's success.
🛻 Monitor and manage the rise of Light Van traffic due to environmental and road usage impact.
🚌 Address the declining use of public transport in non-London regions with targeted policy support.
🧪 Consider integrating monthly or regional-level socioeconomic data for deeper analysis in future work.
✅ This analysis-driven dashboard is built entirely using Streamlit and provides an interactive lens on UK traffic trends from 2000 to 2024.
